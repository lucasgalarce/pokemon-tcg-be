## Explaination

The application includes user registration and authentication. Each user can add custom Pok√©mon cards and view them on their card dashboard. Users have the option to upload an image for each card; if no image is uploaded, a default image will be assigned. Uploaded images are stored using AWS S3. By clicking on a Pok√©mon card, users can initiate a battle against another Pok√©mon card. The winner is determined based on whether the attacking Pok√©mon can defeat the defending Pok√©mon in a single attack, considering weaknesses and resistances for calculation. Battle data is persisted for future use. Types and sets are fetched from an external Pok√©mon TCG API.
